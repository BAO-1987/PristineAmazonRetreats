              Safety is our top priority. Our expeditions are led by experienced

              conduct thorough safety briefings before each excursion, carry
              comprehensive medical kits, and have emergency evacuation plans in
              place. Additionally, our vessels and equipment are meticulously
              maintained to ensure the highest safety standards.
