            Our efforts are focused on minimizing our impact on the environment
            in all aspects of our tours. We implement sustainable practices in
            accommodation, transportation, and interaction with the natural
            resources of the Amazon. Our company holds certificates and
            accreditations confirming our participation in environmentally
            sustainable tourism.
